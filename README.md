# RUSTMOUTH
## Warning!
Rust Mouth and its sub-systems (rustmouth and praat-sys) are very experimental and is in no way shape or form a stable product. Hopefully this will change.

## What is rustmouth?
Rustmouth is a praat API for Rust. It is being written primarily to support the MOSAIC project but it will also hopefully fill a large gap in methodology. 

## Why make a Rust based Praat API?
For very large datasets/corpora, using primarily low level languages like Rust and C++ exponentially increase the processing times.

## Acknowledgements
We heavily acnkowledge and encourage users of rustmouth to also check out [Parselmouth](https://parselmouth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). They are a big inspiration for this project and I can only hope Rustmouth lives up to the same potential.
